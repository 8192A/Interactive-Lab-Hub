# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ The interaction happens at the desk, when user is about to drink water in the cup. 

_Players:_ The person, the cup itself and a lighting coaster will be involed in.

_Activity:_ The coaster will use different color of the light to indicate the temperature of the water in the cup. The blue means cold ice water, the green means room temperature water, the yellow means warm water and the red means hot water.

_Goals:_ Different people have different preference of the temperature of the water. The color will help them to identify the temperature of the water and user will be able to cool the water, or heat the water, or drink water carefully.  

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
<br>Peter has a preference to drink warm water. He believes that drinking warm water has magical power that will bring the wellness. However, he finds it hard to control the temperature of the water. Therefore, he decides to use the lighting coaster. Once he puts the cup on the coaster, the coaster emmits the blue light. This light tells him that the water is cold and he adds more hot water and then the coaster turns yellow! That's the warm water. He is happy to have warm water and have a 'healthy' life. The next time, he has the boiled water in the cup. The coaster now turns red, which indicates that it is a hot water! Therefore, he pour cold water in it and then the coaster turns yellow. 'Healthy' water! Peter is happy.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

<br>Ashley Dai: gradually change the light will be good.
<br>Peter Cho: the heat transfer may not be accurate. Therefore, the design may only fit to several kinds of cup.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
<br>As the interaction was simple, I found that acting out the interaction did not seem to be better than the paper. Acting out even seems to be a bit overkill in this case. <br>
\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
<br>I thought it would be better if the light color had a sound notification when the light turned to yellow.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
<br>This tool did not work well with my Mac. After reaching out to the TA and having a debug session, we still could not figure out how to connect iphone with Mac. There's no error message but nothing was shown in the browser. I use my laptop's screen to change the color manually instead.

## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*
<br>As I could not use the tinkerbelle, I decided to manually setup the light. In my first attempt, I use the color paper to represent the coaster and light. I set the paper color to red color to indicate that the water was hot and let my friend filmed the scene. Then I pour the cold water into the cup and I changed the red paper in to yellow paper to indicates it was warm. Then I did the same thing but pouring the hot water into the cold water, which resulted in the warm water.

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*
<br>After reviewing our video, I found that changing the color with a paper made the demo is really not smooth. Therefore, I used my laptop's screen to change the color.

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
<br>I make it look sqaure instead of circle because I think square may look more sharp and futuristic. I imagined people who use this device will most likely be some sit at desk and work with computer. The sqaure shape is more consistent with the shape of the computer, laptop, and phone. I believe the consistency is very important.

## Part F. Record

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

<br>This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

<br>You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*
<br>Evan Lin: It would be better to change the color of the light gradually.
<br>Donal Michael Thomas Lowsley-Williams: better to sketch the device in 3d instead of 2d.
<br>Sara Wang: Turn off the light when the room is at the desired temperature.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ The interaction happens at the desk, when user wants to drink the water at a **DESIRED** temperature. The coaster will use different color of the light to indicate the temperature of the water in the cup. The blue means cold ice water, the green means room temperature water, the yellow means warm water and the red means hot water. The user will be able to set a range of the temperature as **DESIRED** temperature. When the temperature of the water changes into the **DESIRED** range, the coaster will change the color, vibrate and emmit sound to notify the user. When the temperature goes out of the range of desired temperature, the coaster will change the color, vibrate and emmit a different sound to notify the user.

_Players:_ The person, the cup and a **MAGIC** coaster will be involed in.

_Activity:_ The user set the temperature to a certain range as the desired temperature. User will pour the hot water or the cold water to adjust the temperature of the water in order to reach the desired temperature range. When the temperature enters the range, the coaster changes the color, vibrate and emmit a sound to notify the user. When the temperature goes out of the range of desired temperature, the coaster changes the color, vibrate and emmit a different sound to notify the user.

_Goals:_ Different people have different preference of the temperature of the water. The color will help them to identify the temperature of the water and user will be able to cool the water, or heat the water, or drink water carefully. 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
<br>Peter has a preference to drink warm water. He believes that drinking warm water has magical power that will bring the wellness. However, he finds it hard to control the temperature of the water. Therefore, he decides to use the magic coaster. He sets the desired temperature as 40C - 50C and set the color as yellow. Once he puts the cup on the coaster, the coaster emmits the blue light. This light tells him that the water is cold and he adds more hot water and then the coaster turns yellow, vibrates and emmits a sound notification. That's the warm water. He is happy to have warm water and have a 'healthy' life. The next time, he has the boiled water in the cup. The coaster now turns red, which indicates that it is a hot water! Therefore, he pour cold water in it and then the coaster turns yellow. 'Healthy' water! Peter is happy.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

<br>Ashley Dai: It may be better to make breathing light effect to notify the user, because this can gently remind the user to drink the water
<br>Peter Cho: link to your phone and sent notification, so that the user can be notified even if the user cannot see the cup.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
<br>As the interaction was simple, I found that acting out the interaction did not seem to be better than the paper. Acting out even seems to be a bit overkill in this case. The more important part is to demonstrate how the coaster notify the user. <br>
\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
<br>breathing lighting can be more effective to notify the user

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
<br>After debugging, the Tinkerbelle worked! Not on 5000 but on 5001
<br>**Update** not working again. I changed the port too but did not seem to work this time.

## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*
<br>As I could not use the tinkerbelle, I decided to manually setup the light, made the sound and vibration. This time, I added interaction and story. The video started by introducing my personal preference of the temperature of the water. Then I introduced the magic coaster (which was my phone for the demo purpose). At first, there was a cup with hot water on the 'magic coaster'. I poured the cold water to make it warm. After changing the temperature of the water, I mimic the sound notification and vibration and change the color of the screen to illustrate the interaction. Next time, I did the same thing, but making a cool water warm.

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*
<br>After reviewing our video, I found that I should provide more storytelling and explanation on the changes that happened to the device to better explain how this device could effectively notify the user of the temperature. This could reflect what the user was thinking when notification(color, vibration, sound) was acting.

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*
